My name is Benjamin Brittain, you may know my work from the trail of `TODO(bwb)` left scattered through the codebases of companies such as Google, OkCupid, and Mozilla.

I'm based out of New York City with a focus of building platforms and systems-level software. I'm also a maker and an overland travel enthusiast, frequently by two wheels. I care about open source, correctness, and ensuring what we build does good in the world.

If you'd like to get in contact with me, I'd recommend either twitter or <a href="mailto:ben@brittain.org">ben@brittain.org</a>.
